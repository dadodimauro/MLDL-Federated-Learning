# MLDL-Federated-Learning
 In this report we analyze in depth different feder-
ated learning algorithms. We first start selecting a convolutional
neural network and compute a baseline for reference; we then
proceed to evaluate FedAVG, the first and most adopted solution
in the federated scenario. Moreover, other federated algorithms
are considered, in order to address different issues, for instance
stagglers, client model complexity and classifier calibration. For
each of the aforementioned algorithms we consider one of the
most challenging problems in federated learning, which is dealing
with non-IID data distribution, and compare the results.
